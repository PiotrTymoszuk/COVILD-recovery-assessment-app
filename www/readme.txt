Legal note

The CovILD COVID-19 Pulmonary Recovery Assessement Tools were developed based on the results of 180-day follow-up of the CovILD study cohort (NCT: NCT04416100). The methods of aemi-supervised clustering and machine learning-based prediction of any lung CT abnormalities, moderate-to-severe CT abnormalities (CT severity score > 5) and functional lung impairment are described in the preprint of Sonnweber T et al. (DOI 10.1101/2021.06.22.21259316 ). The app developers and publication authors carry no responsibility for correctness of the risk predictions and the app source code. This tool may not be used for diagnostic purposes. For scientific use only.
